# Compiler_Design
As a part of the course project Compiler Design, our task of designing a compiler for a programming language is broken down into different phases.
the first phase is a simple lexical analyzer.

In this project we plan to implement a lexical analyzer for C language. This lexical analyzer will be able to analyse the following features of C language- 
  1] Data types- int, char, float
  2] Keywords
  3] If...else
  4] While and Nested While loop
  5] Functions with one parameter
  6] Identifiers
  7] Balanced expressions
