# Compiler_Design
As a part of the course project Compiler Design, our task of designing a compiler for a programming language is broken down into different phases.
the first phase is a simple lexical analyzer.

In this project we plan to implement a lexical analyzer for C language. This lexical analyzer will be able to analyse the following features of C language- <br />
  1] Data types- int, char, float <br />
  2] Keywords <br />
  3] If...else <br />
  4] While and Nested While loop <br />
  5] Functions with one parameter <br />
  6] Identifiers <br />
  7] Balanced expressions <br />
