# Compiler_Design
As a part of the course project Compiler Design, our task of designing a compiler for a programming language is broken down into different phases. The first phase is a simple lexical analyzer.

In this project we plan to implement a lexical analyzer for C language. This lexical analyzer will be able to analyse the following features of C language- <br />
  - Data types- int, char, float <br />
  - Keywords <br />
  - If...else <br />
  - While and Nested While loop <br />
  - Functions with one parameter <br />
  - Identifiers <br />
  - Balanced expressions <br />
